<p>You will be exposed to AndroidÂ development tools, explore mobile user interface design, and learn about a few of the user interface elements and user interactions the Android API makes available, but there is no in-depth study of those topics. There are many on-line courses, videos, and blog postings that do a good job covering those topics if you are interested.
