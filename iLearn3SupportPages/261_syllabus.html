<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>	
	CIT 160 - It is expected that you have learned and remember the information made available to you in CIT 160. If you do not, you will need to remediate yourself and relearn what you have forgotten or didn't learn. This will make your experience in this course more difficult--dramatically increasing the amount of time you will need in order to do well. The instructor will do what he can to aid you in your remediation but do not expect a "review" to be done at the beginning of the course. There is not enough time to review an entire semester's worth of learning.

<h1 class="centered">Course Structure</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	This course is designed to allow you to become more professional by learning in an environment where the instructor is your mentor rather than a lecturer. Using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript you will learn to explore technologies in order to resolve problems that arise naturally. You will also learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those same problems through creating an single page mobile web application. Having had such a mentored learning experience is very important when you begin your career. Exploration of tech to solve previously unsoved problems is what you will be doing for your job.
