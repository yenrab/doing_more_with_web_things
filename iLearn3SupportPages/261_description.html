<h2>This is not a Programming Course</h2>
<p>
	You will be exposed to tools, explore mobile user interface design, and learn about a few of the user interface elements and user interactions the HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 make available, this course is not a series of small, tightly defined assignments like programming courses are.

<h2>This is not an Android nor an iOS course</h2>
While you will be exposed to development tools, heavily explore mobile user interface design, and learn about some of the user interface elements and user interactions the Android and iOS web browsers make available, what you will learn here applies to mobile web browsers on both platforms and on desktops. There are many on-line courses, videos, and blog postings that do a good job covering native app development for Android and iOS.

You will learn a great deal about existing libraries and functionality available in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, how to use them, experience more programming techniques, and learn mobile user interface design but this course is much more than just that. It is a course about learning these things while experiencing the software development process and applying software development methodologies.
