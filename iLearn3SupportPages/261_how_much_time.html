<h3>Remediation</h3>
<p>
The history of the class has shown, as indicated in the hours per week table, that those who are less fluent in Java have to work harder and longer to achieve the grade they would like compared to those that are more fluent. If you feel a possible need for remediation, you can do this by retaking CIT 160 or through self study.

<!--
I’ve written a book to help out with self study. It is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/id1035873961">available on Apple’s iTunes book store</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yenrab/doing-stuff-with-java/master/Doing%20Stuff%20with%20Java.pdf">as a PDF</a>. The sample code, PDF version of the book, and other resources are part of the zip file you can download from <a href="https://github.com/yenrab/doing-stuff-with-java">the Doing Stuff with Java gitHub repository</a>.

	I've included links to a few remedial tutorials in the tool helps portion of the course description. They can be a great starting point if you intend to do self study remediation.

<h3>Manage Your Time</h3>
<p>Your time and the time of your teammates is valuable. You will want to manage your time well. There is no suggested order for learning the technical topics in this course. You should put together a personal and team schedule that allows you to get to a fluency level of 'disagree' in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hF-zIoSQOnkijiLjnEUHEhogh4SETIqrpjLEyyp14NY/edit#gid=0">course rubric</a> by the end of week 10.</p>
<p>
Because the assessment items in the 'Code Topics Group' and the 'App Design and Creation Group' in the Rubric total to more than eight, you will not be able to plan to learn one topic a week. Plan ahead.
</p>
<p>
While there is no required or suggested order for you and your team to learn the topics, here is an order that other students have suggested might be good for you. Remember, this doesn't mean one topic per week. All of these are discussed in the book, but you may also need to go online to find more resources after you've read the book or look in the gitHub download for examples of the UML diagrams and documents. Online resources are not helpful with learning the UML for this course.
