<h1 class="centered">Being Successful by Requesting Assessment</h1>



Here is a path and a set of activities to success in this course.
<ol>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(Daily)</span> Personally study one or more technologies on your own time separate from your team.</li>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(At Least Once a Week)</span> Meet with your team to discuss what you and they have learned.</li>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(As Often as Needed)</span> Interact with your instructor verify your understandings, get answers to knowledgeable, well-framed questions, and to get professional design and development opinions.</li>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(Every Other Week)</span> Provide the documentation to your instructor required for a professionalism assessment and recording of your fluency as described below and in the course rubric.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Through your continual interactions with your instructor, and by observing your on-going interactions with your team and classmates, your instructor develops a deep understanding of your fluency and professionalism. They come to know you and how to help you improve your professionalism and increase your technical fluency. This understanding is much deeper than any feedback or evidence a test or quiz could provide. Regardless of if you are in an online or face-to-face class, the assessment is the same but the process differs.
</p>
<h3>For Online Students</h3>
<p>
	In order to help you improve your fluency and professionalism and based on the schedule created by your team, you should regularly upload documentation (code, diagrams, etc.) of your fluency to your gitHub repository. These ungraded uploads are your opportunity to get help and let your instructor see your increasing fluency in one or more technical topics. When you submit this documentation send your instructor a message in the course Google+ community. This way your instructor can give you direct and timely feedback to help you learn and grow. You're fluency is not recorded at this time. Successful students usually need to upload this documentation multiple times before the instructor indicates they are ready to request a recording of their fluency. <span class="bookTitle">You</span> must have created all this documentation, not your team, a tutor, a previous student, the internet, or any other person or source.
</p>
<p> 
	After having assessed your fluency in a technical topic at least once, your instructor will let you know when you are ready to request a recording of your fluency for that topic. You can only request your fluency be recorded every other week. This means there is insufficient time for you to submit these requests for individual code topics. Plan ahead. You will need to submit requests that cover multiple code topics.
</p>
<p>
	When requesting your fluency be recorded, you must submit a document listing each of the topics for which you want your fluency recorded. This fluency document must be written as if it was a letter and you must state you have completed the changes required by your teacher for each of the individual code and diagraming topics to be recorded.
</p>
<p>
	Along with or as part of this letter, you have an oportunity to have your professionalism assessed. To do this, you must upload the professionalism documentation described in the class rubric. Do not request a professionalism assessment without technology fluencies to record. It is your responsibility to prove your fluency and professionalism. It is not the instructor's responsibility to 'pull it out of you.' Be the honest person you are. It will hurt you in life, your career, and the class if you choose to deceive.
</p>
<p>
	Last of all, sign the letter digitally.
</p>
<p>
Online students can see an example letter below.
</p>

<h3>For Face-to-Face Students</h3>
<p>
	In order to help you improve your fluency and professionalism, you should try to meet with your instructor about every other week in their office (<a href="http://www.meetme.so/LeeBarney">Schedule a time on my calendar</a>). These semiweekly fluency and professionalism assessments are your opportunity to provide the direct evidence described in the rubric in order to achieve your goal. <span class="bookTitle">You</span> must have created this evidence, not your team, a tutor, a previous student, the internet, or any other person or source. You will sign up for a <span class = "bookTitle">10 minute</span> meeting in which you will declare the one or more topics for which you have previously been assessed on in class. Then your professionalism will be assessed based on the instructor's observations of and interactions with you. <span class = "bookTitle">This is not a slide presentation.</span> In class, your instructor will determine if you know and understand how to use the topic, what options the topic gives you when coding and designing, you are using and understanding the topic correctly, and you can fully explain the topic fluently and well. After being assessed, you can, if you desire, spend additional time further developing fluency and then provide more evidence on that topic in class. This recursive process is used for assessing both the coding and the diagram fluency. Face-to-Face students shouldn't submit a letter in the form you see below, but should come to the 10 minute meeting with the same kinds of information and documentation.<p>

<h3>Online Student - Fluency Letter and Documentation Example (Getting to Disagree in the class rubric)</h3>

<p>
	If you are an online student you will need to submit to your instructor documentation in order to have your fluency assessed and updated. Below is an example of a document that would move your fluency assessment from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Disagree' for the technologies listed in the letter as described in the course rubric. It also includes a request to reassess the professionalism of the student submitting the letter.

	Sister Jones,<br>

	Previously I submitted sandbox code for each of the following topics to you. I have made the changes you suggested and am now requesting that my fluency be recorded and moved from Strongly Disagree to Disagree.
	<ul>
		<li>Local Storage API, Storing and Retrieving Simple Data, Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects</li>
		<li>Using XMLHTTPRequest to Consume a JSON Web Service</li>
		<li>HTML5 Tags - Video, Audio, Canvas, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	I also am providing you evidence of my professionalism as described in the 'Being Successful by being Assessed' portion of the course description and in the course rubric.

	<ol>
	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Interacting Professionally with the Instructor:</span> I have asked questions of you regarding these three topics, and have kept you up-to-date on the schedule changes our team made since I last claimed fluency. One question I asked was, "I've been working on learning to use XMLHTTPRequest. I think I understand how it works, but how do I access the data I get back when using an API like snapChat's?"</li>
	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Interacting Helpfully and Professionally with Other Teams:</span> As you can see from <a>this link to a Google+ group discussion</a>, I shared with another team what I previously learned about using Video tags to record videos.</li>
	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Supporting the Team by Teaching, etc.</span> - Here is a <a>link to a Google+ hangout where I am teaching my team about JavaScript loops and arrays. You can hear me teaching at the 3:20 time stamp in the video.</li>

	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Self-Reflection/Meta-Cognition:</span> I had a meta-cognative moment this week. I was in sacrament meeting listening to a ward member speak about the importance of scripture reading. This is something I have had trouble doing consistantly. I started wondering why. Then I started pondering, "Why do I think scripture reading isn't important enough to do every day?" I realized I was thinking of scripture reading as being an extra thing I should do when I already have a busy schedule with my family, my job, and my church calling. I realized and have now started to think of scripture reading as the foundation of anything I want or need to accomplish. It isn't optional to me anymore. My thinking has changed.</li>

	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Team's Agile Methodology:</span> Our team is using the scrum method. Since I last submitted an assessment request I've been participating in our scrum daily standup meetings, working on my assigned scrum sprint, and attending and participating in our other team meetings.</li>

	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Professional Scheduling Group:</span> At this point I've met all of the scheduled commitments I've made to the team for delivery of teaching and code. The schedule has had to be modified a little because it took me a little more time to understand Local Storage than I thought it would. You can see the schedule I'm working against and the dates I've delivered what I was responsible for to my team <a  href="" onclick="stopDefault(event)">at this link</a>.

<h3>Online Student - Fluency Letter and Documentation Example (Getting to Agree or Strongly Agree in the class rubric)</h3>

<p>
	If you are an online student you will need to submit to your instructor documentation in order to have your fluency assessed and updated. Below is an example of a document that would move your fluency assessment from 'Disagree' to either 'Agree or Strongly Agree' for the technologies listed in the letter. Whether you are assessed as Agree, Strongly Agree, staying at Disagree, or shifted to Strongly Disagree depends on the perception of your instructor. It is your job to make sure your instructor has interacted with you enough to be able to make this judgement. If you have not involved your instructor suffificently, and there is no hard definition of what sufficiently means, your instructor will not have the knowledge and understanding of you to reassess your fluency. Without that understanding your instructor will not update your fluency assessment. Instead, they will ask you to create something else and keep them involved. <span class="bookTitle">Do not</span> waste your time. Keep your instructor deeply involved in all of your work. They are a member of your team.

	Sister Jones,<br>

	I have already achived a Disagree level of fluency for all of the Code Topics and the UML and Testing groups. I would like to have my fluency re-assessed for the following topics.
	<ul>
		<li>Local Storage API, Storing and Retrieving Simple Data, Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects</li>
		<li>Using XMLHTTPRequest to Consume a JSON Web Service</li>
		<li>HTML5 Tags - Video, Audio, Canvas, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	I also am providing you evidence of my professionalism as described in the 'Being Successful by being Assessed' portion of the course description and in the course rubric.

	<ol>
	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Interacting Professionally with the Instructor:</span> I have asked questions of you regarding these three topics, and have kept you up-to-date on the schedule changes our team made since I last claimed fluency. I have shared with you my UML design documents and the source code for my project. To help you remember our interactions, here are some links to the postings in the team community.

	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">Self-Reflection/Meta-Cognition:</span> I have come to realize that I'm thinking differently than I did at the beginning of the semester. I used to think I needed to know everything I could about something before I could use it. I also thought I had to be perfect in what I did. I now realize how wrong I was and how that type of thinking was inhibiting me and making my life harder than it had to be.</li>
